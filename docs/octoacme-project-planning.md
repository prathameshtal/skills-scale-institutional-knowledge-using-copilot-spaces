# OctoAcme — Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders and delivery team
2. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria (**Product Manager** with **Business Analyst**)
3. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points) — **Developers** collaborate
4. Define Definition of Done (DoD) — includes quality gates from **QA Lead**
5. Identify dependencies and integration points — **DevOps Engineer** assesses infrastructure needs
6. Create release plan and milestone map — **Project Manager** coordinates
7. Design review and approval — **UX Designer** presents designs
